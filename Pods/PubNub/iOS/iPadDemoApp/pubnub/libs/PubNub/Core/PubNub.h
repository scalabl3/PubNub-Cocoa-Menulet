 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientErrorNotification,

 Unsubscribe client from set of channels.
 
 @code
 @endcode
 This method extends \a +unsubscribeFromChannels: method and allow to specify on whether presence event should be generated or not.
 If \b PubNub client already subscribed on some channels and \a 'withPresenceEvent' will be set to \c YES, than \b PubNub will issue \a 'leave' 
 presence event on old channels and generate \a 'join' presence event on rest of the channels. If \a 'withPresenceEvent' is set to \c NO than 
 \b PubNub client will silently unsubscribe from old channels and re-subscribe on rest on the channels w/o any presence events.
 
 @code
 @endcode
 \b Example:
 
 @code
 [PubNub setConfiguration:[PNConfiguration defaultConfiguration] andDelegate:self];
 [PubNub connect];
 [PubNub subscribeFromChannel:[PNChannel channelsWithName:@"iosdev"]];
 [PubNub sendMessage:@"PubNub welcomes iOS developers" toChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"]];
 [PubNub unsubscribeFromChannel:[PNChannel channelsWithName:@"iosdev"] withPresenceEvent:YES];
 @endcode

 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didUnsubscribeOnChannels:(NSArray *)channels {

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client unsubscriptionDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {
 
     // PubNub client did fail to unsubscribe from provided set of channels (they are in 'error.associatedObject') of 'error'.

          // push notifications.
      }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientPushNotificationEnableDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientPushNotificationEnableDidFailNotification.

 @param channels
 Array of \b PNChannel instances for which push notification should be enabled.
 
 @param pushToken
 Device push token which is used to identify push notification recipient.
 
 @param handlerBlock
 The block which is called when push notification enabling state changed. The block takes two arguments:
 \c channels - list of channels for which push notification enabling state changed; \c error - error because of which push notification enabling
 failed. Always check \a error.code to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use \a -localizedDescription /
 \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
 
 @note PubNub service will keep sending push notifications till PubNub client explicitly disable them on specified channel or on all at once.
 
 @warning Only last call of this method will call completion block. If you need to track push notification enabling process from many places,
 use \b PNObservationCenter methods for this purpose.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'read' access right and revoke \a 'write' access right for

 @warning \a 'channel' access level is mid-layer of access tree. If \a 'user' access level grant \a 'write' access rights, 
 then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that mid-layer forbid \a 'write' access right and allow specific user (which has been granted 
 with \a 'write' access right) to post messages into target channel (for which \a 'write' access right has been granted).
 
 @param channel
 \b PNChannel instance for which \b PubNub client should change access rights to \a 'read'.

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'channel' access level is granted with \a 'read' access rights.
 
 @param handlerBlock
 The block which will be called by \b PubNub client when one of success or error events will be received. The block takes two arguments:
 \c collection - \b PNAccessRightsCollection instance which hold set of \b PNAccessRightsInformation instances to
 describe new \a 'channel' access rights; \c error - error which describes what exactly went wrong
 during access rights change. Always check \a error.code to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file

 [PubNub setupWithConfiguration:[PNConfiguration configurationForOrigin:@"pubsub.pubnub.com" publishKey:@"demo"
                                                           subscribeKey:@"demo" secretKey:@"my-secret-key"]
                    andDelegate:self];
 [PubNub connect];
 [PubNub grantReadAccessRightForChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"] forPeriod:10 clients:@[@"spectator", @"visitor"]];
 [PubNub grantWriteAccessRightForChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"] forPeriod:10];
 @endcode

 Code above configure access rights in a way, which won't allow message posting for clients with \a 'spectator' and \a 'visitor' 
 authorization keys into \a 'iosdev' channel for \b 10 minutes. But despite the fact that \a 'iosdev' channel access
 rights allow only subscription for \a 'spectator' and \a 'visitor', \b PubNub client allowed to post messages to any channels because of upper-layer
 configuration (\a 'channel' access level allow message posting to any channels for \b 10 minutes).

 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didChangeAccessRights:(PNAccessRightsCollection *)accessRightsCollection {

     // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'user' access level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'user' access level.
     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
     // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
     // has been requested.
 }
 @endcode

 There is also way to observe access rights change process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'user' access level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'user' access level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
         // has been requested.
     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'read' access right and revoke \a 'write' access right for
 \a 'user' access level.

 @warning \a 'user' access level is low-layer of access tree. If one of upper layers will grant \a 'write' access rights,

 this value (\a 'application' or \a 'channel' access level) will allow message posting to all channels and for all 
 (in case if \a 'write' access rights granted on \a 'application' access level) or allow messsage posting for all into specific 
 channel (for channel which is granted with \a 'write' access rights).

                  }
 }];

 @endcode

 Code above configure access rights in a way, which won't allow subscription to \a 'iosdev', \a 'androiddev' and \a 'macosdev' channels
 for \b 10 minutes. But despite the fact that\a 'iosdev', \a 'androiddev' and \a 'macosdev' channels access rights
 allow only message posting, \b PubNub client allowed to post subscribe to any channels because of upper-layer configuration (\a 'application' access level allow subscription
 to any channels for \b 10 minutes).

 And handle it with delegates:

     // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /

     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
     // has been requested.
 }
 @endcode

 There is also way to observe access rights change process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.

         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /

         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change

     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'write' access right and revoke \a 'read' access right for

 @warning \a 'channel' access level is mid-layer of access tree. If \a 'user' access level grant \a 'read' access rights,
 then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that mid-layer forbid \a 'read' access right and allow specific user (which has been granted
 with \a 'read' access right) to subscribe on target channel (for which \a 'read' access right has been granted).
 
 @param channels
 List of \b PNChannel instances for which \b PubNub client should change access rights to \a 'write'.

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'channel' access level is granted with \a 'write' access rights.
